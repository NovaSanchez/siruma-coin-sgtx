## Heading White Paper | S1RUMACOIN

*DEV (SGTX-codename) 

## Summary

The S1 token is an innovative solution that deals with transparency    challenges in the use of government funds. This token lets taxpayers   verify the destiny and efficiency of the collected capital by mayors   and governorships.
       Based on the ERC-20 standard and operating under the PulseChain    network, S1 can be acquired by paying taxes. This token gives    citizens a powerful tool to supervise and ease governmental    authorities’ reporting processes.
       S1rumaCoin (S1) provides a technological solution to promote    transparency and accountability around the use of government funds.    By associating each tax transaction with S1 issuance in the    PulseChain network, the system creates an immutable and transparent    registry of how the collected capital is invested.
       Citizens can verify these transactions in real-time through    blockchain and other tools available in the network. By using S1GAT,   the taxpayer will have incentives and rewards when paying their    fiscal obligations.
       Moreover, they will be able to invest their tokens in mayors’    projects. This will promote total transparency in the financial    management of the projects that support the well-being and security    of citizens.

### Visión

S1rumaCoin (S1) is a token that works over the ERC-20 standard and the PulseChain network. The objective consists of introducing this token in the market through the creation of incentives that convert this token into a commodity that, after reaching certain marketability, converts into a coin that serves as a means of payment in the Venezuelan market in the short term with a view to the international market in the long term.

#### Issue

Given the economic challenges, mainly inflation, the actual world faces, it has emerged the need for a parallel economic system.

Since the 2008 crisis, interest rates haven’t been raised. Recently, central banks around the world tried to lower the issuance and public debt. The Federal Reserve tried several strategies to achieve that goal without success. Rather, the debt increased.

This situation puts the dollar and the actual financial system in a vulnerable position. For the very characteristics of the banking system, the world economy, led by the dollar, needs a constant issuance of bank bills, that is, this issuance can’t be stopped. Otherwise, the system can’t sustain itself and will crumble as a result.

However, it is only a matter of time until the truth comes out: banks don’t have enough resources to honor all payments (their obligations as a bank). When this happens, central banks issue more coins to rescue big corporations at the expense of citizens' savings.

#### Solution

Through S1rumaCoin (S1), it is possible to create a parallel payment system unattached to the dollar. Instead, it will be tied to real transactions done in Venezuela's economy. SIRUMATEK is promoting the necessary means to create a sovereign economy where S1 will work as the main means of payment.

This token will help with:

Transparency in the payment and management of taxes received by the  government.
   
   2.  The management of projects with a social impact.
   
   3.  The fiscal control of economic activities.
   
   4.  The geolocation of economic activities.
   
   5.  The financial transactions done by the local community.
   
   6.  The execution of economic transactions in the Venezuelan market.
   
   7.  The stabilization of our local coin (Bolivar)
   
   8.  The hiring of cooperative identity services.
   
   9.  The promotion of sustainable development.
   
   10.  The territorial planning.
   
   11.  The control and follow-up of the government management.

    

#### Target market

In the first phase, S1 will work in the Venezuelan market. The main users will be those Venezuelans collaborating with the real economy and national production. Whoever is willing to give the best for the city, the community, or the village can participate.

El token S1 has an advantage: it protects holders from national capital flights by limiting transactions between token holders. The goal is to build enough trust in mayors to keep holding the coins. Nonetheless, this is optional as the p2p transactions can be enabled, so holders can spend their coins as they see fit.

Yet, the mechanism to approve wire transfers made by third parties, basic in any ERC-20 contracts, is exposed and enabled, which means our platform will let owners transfer tokens by carefully considering any holders’ permit and the platform based on the current legislation.

#### Innovation

The value proposition around S1 consists in creating an alternate payment system to the actual financial system. This is an effort to detach the Venezuelan economy from the dollar to avoid any influence from the actual world economic crisis.

#### Cooperators

The cooperators in charge of this project are:

1.  Ivan Ochoa: [curriculum]
    
2.  Guillermo Sánchez: Programmer [curriculum]
    
3.  [Ludwig Laborda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludwiglaborda/): Researcher and content writer.
    

#### Financial summary

S1rumaCoin will have a starting price of one bolivar per token. This parity will change based on the bolivar’s issuance. Every mayor will issue a fixed amount of tokens. The issuance of new tokens will be tied to the integration of new participants who seek to join our platform. These participants will be, in the beginning, mayors who will have enough incentives to trade bolivars for tokens. They are known as holders.

At the end of each accounting period, a proposal for a new issuance of tokens will be presented which will be directly related to the tax collection and the achievement of raised objectives. Lastly, in the case any holder wants to exit, the coins in their wallets will be destroyed, transferring them to the contract address, which doesn’t have a mechanism to replenish said coins.

The token can also be used as a means of contracts to reserve services that guarantee the transactions between suppliers and consumers of the real economy in Venezuela.

The functioning of the token will be specific based on the type of service SIRUMATEK offers.

#### Roadmap

-   Token’s HomePage going live (a web page to show the token’s vision and mission immersed in the GovTech trend).
    
-   Set up regular and official channels to share token news and interact with customers. (Telegram, Discord, Instagram, and WhatsApp)  
    [Estimated date release: As soon as this whitepaper is published. The URL would be something like E.G: Telegram @XXXXXXXX …]
    
-   Token’s deployment in PulseChain MaiNnet  
    [Estimated date release] [contract address]
    
-   Integration with S1GAT  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Release of S1rumaCoin wallet: It will let users and taxpayers manage their tokens using their smartphones so that they can trade them or use them to pay their bills and obligations.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s deployment in Tron MainNet  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration with the Tron MainNet  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s deployment in the BNB network.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration in the Binance Smart Chain  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration with the Banco Municipal: Since the bank will use collected taxes by mayors to finance projects with social impact, the main integration will consist of using said collected taxes to buy tokens and invest in those projects. For this, an exchange platform will be needed, or connecting the bank with the networks where the token will be deployed, so that holders can trade S1 for bolivars or any other coin.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Bridge to exchange tokens in the available networks. Users will be able to exchange tokens with any cost associated. This way, the token will acquire commercial value in the main and related networks.

# Smart Contracts for Digital Signatures with Commercial Licenses  Managed by  S1GAT

  

# Summary:

This whitepaper describes the design and functionality of a smart contract developed in the PulseChain network to keep encrypted data of taxpayers’ commercial licenses safe and transparent for mayors operating in S1GAT. The smart contract guarantees the immutability of license data and enables the digital signature of securities, ensuring its authenticity and safety. Furthermore, taxpayers can follow up their commercial licenses through blockchain by using block browsers deployed in the network, just like the ones S1GAT offers.

# 1.  Introduction:

The licenses for economic activities are permits for taxpayers so they can operate commercially under the jurisdiction of a given mayor. Thanks to the tax management system, S1GAT, mayors can manage tax collection in a better way. Since these taxes are tied up, legally and systematically, to a commercial license, the user can pay their taxes comfortably and can consult any details of all the commercial licenses they hold.

To generate trust in taxpayers, and because of the central government requirements regarding sending and storage of messages, a digital signature that generates unique and unrepeatable characters is needed. These characters will share information about the economic activity of a company such as issuance date and expiration date.

A smart contract is the best solution because it lets you keep and sign the supplied data that confirms the authenticity of a license by S1GAT, tying a digital signature with a taxpayer. This way, we go one step forward with the GovTech concept.

## Smart Contract Objective

Storage, safe, immutable, and transparent, the data of commercial licenses in digital signatures by using data encryption, ensuring admin and taxpayer privacy, and the verification and following up of the data stored in these signatures.

# 2. Smart Contract Design:

While researching the ecosystem standards, we couldn’t find one with a framework similar to the smart contract we need. That's why we propose a new type of standard to store, retrieve, and confirm the signed data beside a unique and applicable method for multiple areas.

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ubHqlC2HLYsYWMyeX0vicBgMuvXISgPUHI4aYQ3nl_QwYrryFPA_MOLAmhr6CmZ9LSV-R8-bzZF4ELfWriGtgxiK1_ZMheebdkaJ6-7zNIEBTJ1DXThKMw6HiWyBrzLQDP7sStfjElBDvO_Y0uGyC0g)

One of our main focal points for research went around the ERC-721 standard, which is known as a non-fungible token, unique and with only one owner. Nonetheless, the stored data in the contract was not enough to generate the desired trust to support taxpayers.

These are the mechanism and main actors of the smart contract:

1.  Owner
    
2.  Admins who can approve and remove signatures.
    
3.  Holders, who can use the signatures as they please, access mint methods, obtain the securities and validate the said signature.
    

## 4. Security and transparency:

For the recording process of licenses’ signatures, it is necessary to sign up holders and admins in private internal dictionaries, which can be accessed only by owners. As an exception, admins can access this data too whenever they want to validate holders by address or ID.

In the event a user has both roles, admin and holder, they won’t be able to approve their signature; rather, another admin must approve it. When creating a signature, several pieces of data are needed to sign, plus admins and holders' data, which are validated in real-time. This way, the system can send early alerts for any duplicated data, for example.

Besides this, there are additional methods that, given the values, can confirm this data and ensure it is recorded correctly in the smart contract so that frauds are avoided. Lastly, admins can remove licenses following the rules established by mayors or the central government.

However, while running this process, a new event stems that communicates the removal of a certain license for a holder which can be scanned. Yet, this information is stored and can only be accessed by the holder or the owner.

## 5. Use cases and advantages for users:

The main purpose of smart contracts is to ensure the authenticity of an economic license date by S1GAT. With this, the taxpayer can access and verify their data through the integration of multiple platforms.

The most common is using a blockchain browser, yet we are planning to create a digital wallet that will let the holder verify their license data, follow up on its status, and share that data with admins. This is a practical and ecological way to carry and use their licenses.

This is not the only possible use of the smart contract. There are other realities and potentialities associated with them. In Latin America, the use of smart contracts is not widespread, either because they associate blockchain technology with cryptocurrencies or because the information hasn’t been explained properly.

However, there are some examples of how companies have taken advantage of smart contracts to ease transactions with public and private organizations. For example, Koibanx managed around 52 million Colombian pesos between 2016 and 2018 which let governments and citizens celebrate transparent contracts.

The Corporación Nacional del Cobre de Chile (CODELCO)  gives us another use case for smart contracts. All their documents are encrypted and stored in blockchain, which lets them organize and accelerate company transactions.

Similarly, the Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional (CEN) uses smart contracts to follow up each megawatt hour of renewable energy, from the moment it is generated to its final consumption. Lastly, Thomas Signe, through its program GOUZE, follows up all the processes their clients’ commodities have to go through, from its production to its sale; all of this is done securely and transparently.

Regarding the potentialities, smart contracts are great for any transaction requiring a third party. In this case, the smart contract would function as the third party. In concrete terms, Venezuela could shelter the data generated in transactions celebrated in the stock exchange, in legal activities like selling/buying movable and immovable property, and celebrate work contracts with an escrow where the funds are released once the milestones are met, among other applications.

## 6. Deployment and future enhancements:

As a main and first step, the token will be deployed in the PulseChain network. Yet, we want to expand this deployment to other networks to increase the token’s possibilities. Some of them are the financial network Smart Chain, Tron network Ethereum, or any of their second-layer networks.

For the moment, we have done the main deployment, that is, our main actor, S1GAT, is integrated with our API as shown in the following graphic.

## 8. Roadmap:

-   Smart contra WebPage going live. The website will have a landing page to show the fundamental elements of the smart contract plus an additional view to download this document.  
    [release date: It will be the same date this document is released which will happen before the smart contract publication in the main net].
    
-   Set up channels to support our clients through Telegram and WhatsApp.  
    [release date: Same as this document’s]
    
-   Release of the app that will let holders carry the digital signature and share the actual status of their license for economic activities.  
    [release date: Six months after the deployment of the smart contract].
    
-   Release of the app that validates signatures for public workers. This app will guarantee them access to a bank of data related to licenses in a given territory as well as update a license status as they see fit.  
    [release date: Six months after the deployment of the smart contract].
    

## 9. Conclusions:

In summary, the market release of smart contracts for digital signatures related to commercial licenses operated in S1GAT constitutes an additional step towards governance that employs technological means to serve taxpayers in the best way possible.

Therefore, it is an additional effort to facilitate common transactions established by the actual legislation and support public workers with their daily tasks.

Lastly, the exercise of these smart contracts opens the gates for additional usages and solutions in other areas of the national economy, from the stock exchange to sending and receiving securities all over the country.
