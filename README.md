## Heading White Paper | S1RUMACOIN  

## Summary

The S1 token is an innovative solution that deals with transparency    challenges in the use of government funds. This token lets taxpayers   verify the destiny and efficiency of the collected capital by mayors   and governorships.
       Based on the ERC-20 standard and operating under the PulseChain    network, S1 can be acquired by paying taxes. This token gives    citizens a powerful tool to supervise and ease governmental    authorities’ reporting processes.
       S1rumaCoin (S1) provides a technological solution to promote    transparency and accountability around the use of government funds.    By associating each tax transaction with S1 issuance in the    PulseChain network, the system creates an immutable and transparent    registry of how the collected capital is invested.
       Citizens can verify these transactions in real-time through    blockchain and other tools available in the network. By using S1GAT,   the taxpayer will have incentives and rewards when paying their    fiscal obligations.
       Moreover, they will be able to invest their tokens in mayors’    projects. This will promote total transparency in the financial    management of the projects that support the well-being and security    of citizens.

### Visión

S1rumaCoin (S1) is a token that works over the ERC-20 standard and the PulseChain network. The objective consists of introducing this token in the market through the creation of incentives that convert this token into a commodity that, after reaching certain marketability, converts into a coin that serves as a means of payment in the Venezuelan market in the short term with a view to the international market in the long term.

#### Issue

Given the economic challenges, mainly inflation, the actual world faces, it has emerged the need for a parallel economic system.

Since the 2008 crisis, interest rates haven’t been raised. Recently, central banks around the world tried to lower the issuance and public debt. The Federal Reserve tried several strategies to achieve that goal without success. Rather, the debt increased.

This situation puts the dollar and the actual financial system in a vulnerable position. For the very characteristics of the banking system, the world economy, led by the dollar, needs a constant issuance of bank bills, that is, this issuance can’t be stopped. Otherwise, the system can’t sustain itself and will crumble as a result.

However, it is only a matter of time until the truth comes out: banks don’t have enough resources to honor all payments (their obligations as a bank). When this happens, central banks issue more coins to rescue big corporations at the expense of citizens' savings.

#### Solution

Through S1rumaCoin (S1), it is possible to create a parallel payment system unattached to the dollar. Instead, it will be tied to real transactions done in Venezuela's economy. SIRUMATEK is promoting the necessary means to create a sovereign economy where S1 will work as the main means of payment.

This token will help with:

Transparency in the payment and management of taxes received by the  government.
   
   2.  The management of projects with a social impact.
   
   3.  The fiscal control of economic activities.
   
   4.  The geolocation of economic activities.
   
   5.  The financial transactions done by the local community.
   
   6.  The execution of economic transactions in the Venezuelan market.
   
   7.  The stabilization of our local coin (Bolivar)
   
   8.  The hiring of cooperative identity services.
   
   9.  The promotion of sustainable development.
   
   10.  The territorial planning.
   
   11.  The control and follow-up of the government management.

    

#### Target market

In the first phase, S1 will work in the Venezuelan market. The main users will be those Venezuelans collaborating with the real economy and national production. Whoever is willing to give the best for the city, the community, or the village can participate.

El token S1 has an advantage: it protects holders from national capital flights by limiting transactions between token holders. The goal is to build enough trust in mayors to keep holding the coins. Nonetheless, this is optional as the p2p transactions can be enabled, so holders can spend their coins as they see fit.

Yet, the mechanism to approve wire transfers made by third parties, basic in any ERC-20 contracts, is exposed and enabled, which means our platform will let owners transfer tokens by carefully considering any holders’ permit and the platform based on the current legislation.

#### Innovation

The value proposition around S1 consists in creating an alternate payment system to the actual financial system. This is an effort to detach the Venezuelan economy from the dollar to avoid any influence from the actual world economic crisis.

#### Cooperators

The cooperators in charge of this project are:

1.  Ivan Ochoa: [curriculum]
    
2.  Guillermo Sánchez: Programmer [curriculum]
    
3.  [Ludwig Laborda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ludwiglaborda/): Researcher and content writer.
    

#### Financial summary

S1rumaCoin will have a starting price of one bolivar per token. This parity will change based on the bolivar’s issuance. Every mayor will issue a fixed amount of tokens. The issuance of new tokens will be tied to the integration of new participants who seek to join our platform. These participants will be, in the beginning, mayors who will have enough incentives to trade bolivars for tokens. They are known as holders.

At the end of each accounting period, a proposal for a new issuance of tokens will be presented which will be directly related to the tax collection and the achievement of raised objectives. Lastly, in the case any holder wants to exit, the coins in their wallets will be destroyed, transferring them to the contract address, which doesn’t have a mechanism to replenish said coins.

The token can also be used as a means of contracts to reserve services that guarantee the transactions between suppliers and consumers of the real economy in Venezuela.

The functioning of the token will be specific based on the type of service SIRUMATEK offers.

#### Roadmap

-   Token’s HomePage going live (a web page to show the token’s vision and mission immersed in the GovTech trend).
    
-   Set up regular and official channels to share token news and interact with customers. (Telegram, Discord, Instagram, and WhatsApp)  
    [Estimated date release: As soon as this whitepaper is published. The URL would be something like E.G: Telegram @XXXXXXXX …]
    
-   Token’s deployment in PulseChain MaiNnet  
    [Estimated date release] [contract address]
    
-   Integration with S1GAT  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Release of S1rumaCoin wallet: It will let users and taxpayers manage their tokens using their smartphones so that they can trade them or use them to pay their bills and obligations.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s deployment in Tron MainNet  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration with the Tron MainNet  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s deployment in the BNB network.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration in the Binance Smart Chain  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Token’s integration with the Banco Municipal: Since the bank will use collected taxes by mayors to finance projects with social impact, the main integration will consist of using said collected taxes to buy tokens and invest in those projects. For this, an exchange platform will be needed, or connecting the bank with the networks where the token will be deployed, so that holders can trade S1 for bolivars or any other coin.  
    [Estimated date release]
    
-   Bridge to exchange tokens in the available networks. Users will be able to exchange tokens with any cost associated. This way, the token will acquire commercial value in the main and related networks.
